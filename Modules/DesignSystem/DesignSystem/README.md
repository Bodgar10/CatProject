# DesignSystem Module

The `DesignSystem` module is designed to provide reusable UI components built with SwiftUI. It aims to ensure consistency across the application's user interface while promoting modularity and reusability. This module focuses on offering generic, flexible, and configurable components rather than entire screens or application logic.

## Objective

The `DesignSystem` module centralizes the design and implementation of UI elements such as buttons, labels, inputs, and other reusable SwiftUI components. By using this module, teams can ensure a cohesive visual identity and reduce duplicated efforts in implementing common UI patterns.

## Contents

### What Should Be Included

- **Reusable SwiftUI Components**: Generic and configurable views such as buttons, text fields, toggles, progress indicators, etc.
- **Style Definitions**: Shared colors, typography, spacings, and other design tokens that define the application's visual identity.
- **Modifiers**: SwiftUI view modifiers to encapsulate reusable styling or behavior logic.
- **Preview Support**: Components should include SwiftUI previews to facilitate testing and visualization in Xcode.
- **Accessibility Support**: Ensure all components meet accessibility guidelines, such as dynamic font sizes and voice-over compatibility.

---

### What Should NOT Be Included

- **Complete Screens**: Full views or layouts specific to a feature or business logic should not be included.
- **Business Logic**: Any logic unrelated to UI rendering or styling should reside in the appropriate feature or domain module.
- **Network or Data Handling**: Avoid including functionality related to fetching or processing data; this should belong to networking or state management modules.
- **Non-Generic UI Elements**: Avoid adding highly specific components tied to a single use case.
